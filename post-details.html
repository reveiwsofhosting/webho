                      <ul class="post-info">
                        <li><a href="#">Admin</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#">May 12, 2020</a></li>
                       
                      </ul>
                      <p>  For beginners, it’s very difficult to characteristics between which website is static and which one is dynamic. There is millions of website around the world. if we talk about websites they are basically of two types static and dynamic. in this article, I fully explain to you about static and dynamic websites, about their advantages and disadvantages, and how they are different from each other.</p>
                      <h2>static websites</h2>
                      <p>A static website is a basic website, you don’t need any kind of programming language or database knowledge to make these types of websites. these pages are coded in HTML(hypertext markup language).these types of websites are fully controlled by their developer you cannot make any changes to this website, changes mean like updating, deleting create new posts .you can understand it like that static websites are like the newspaper you can learn that news, you cant comment on it or you cant change it.

 basically, these types of websites are used for portfolio and blogging to share his thoughts on the internet. every static website has a minimum of 3 pages type. in the static website when the client request the server to display web pages it directly responds from server to browser and the browser displays it. I want to say that static websites are a faster response time as compare to dynamic websites. these websites are known as static because we can’t do any change as a user changes can only be done by the developer.
</p>
                      <ul><li><h3>Disadvantages</h3></li>
                        <p>  The big disadvantage of a static website is that every time when you request to sever every time it has to open a new webpage which slows down the website.
 suppose that you are a blogger or you have to upload daily one blog on your website on your static website it means that you have to make a new page in HTML to share that blog on your website, whereas in dynamic you don’t need to write the whole page you have to just write and upload it.
You cant restrict the user to see some specific content that you don’t want to show him, in a static website every data you upload can be seen by everyone 
You cannot use third-party apps on static websites.
</p>
                        <li><h3>Advantages</h3></li>
                        <p>These websites are more flexible. or you don’t need any kind of programming knowledge. A beginner can easily make this kind of without taking help of coders.
There are cheaply to host because hosting providers don’t need any server-side languages or database. these websites have good loading speed.
These types of websites are very good for bloggers. these websites are more secure than dynamic because these websites are handled by only one person.
</p>
                        </ul>
                      <h2>Dynamic websites</h2>
                      <p>   In dynamic websites when a user requests to the server, the response is processed during the runtime in the server-side language like ASP, Django, flask. according to the request of the user then they go through the database to authentication user details then provide to the browser and the browser displays it request. that is the reason why static sites are faster than dynamic websites. to create a dynamic website you have to good in programming languages and databases or in server-side languages. dynamic websites are a collection of dynamic web pages which responds user according to their request .also it costs high as compared to static websites. the dynamic pages are those pages on which you can respond.

Suppose we have to talk to your friend so you will go to Facebook and talk you can share your media file there.it means the websites where you can respond or you can saw the respond of other guys is known as dynamic websites.it generates a new HTML file for every new response.
There lot of site son internet that is an example of dynamic websites like survey forms and corona trackers and a lot of other websites. dynamic website has CMS(content management system) which easily updates and modifies your websites, without writing much code.
</p>
                      <ul><li><h3>Disadvantages</h3></li>
                        <p>
Dynamic websites are not for beginners. you need very good programming knowledge to develop a dynamic website.
Hosting dynamic websites is more expensive than a static website because to host a dynamic website you need a server that has server-site language and also has a database and good CMS.
These websites are slower as compare to static websites due to their database and lot of contents.
</p>
                        <li><h3>Advantages</h3></li>
                        <p>
<li>You can easily update your site content as compared to static websites a user can get new content every time it loaded.</li>
                      <li>    You can easily restrict any user to show the contents of other users.</li>
                    <li>  It is more secure than static websites.</li>
<li>one of the big advantages of dynamic websites is that you can change their Ip address whenever you need but you can not change the IP address of the static website, it will remain the same always.</li>
<li>You can also add more functionality to your website by using third-party apps or using API features.</li>
<li>You can easily backup your important contents and files in the database on a dynamic website.</li>
</p>
                        </ul>
                      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                      <p> I explained every merits and demerit of static and dynamic websites in this article, using the knowledge you can easily choose which type of website is good for you .bascially type of website is depend on your knowledge and your need if you want to make a responsive website where user can chat and share their thoughts, then you have to make a dynamic website three is also a lot of hosting website which can help you to make a dynamic website. if you have to make a small website for your portfolio or to show your business you can easily go with a static website. their lot of free website which provides free templates. in nowadays you don’t need much knowledge to build a website there is a lot no of website building platform with which you can easily make your own website and the last thing is that type of site is depending on your need. </p>
